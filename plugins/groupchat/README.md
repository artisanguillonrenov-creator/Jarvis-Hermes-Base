# Groupchat

Groupchat is an opt-in Hermes plugin for cooperative agents in shared chats. It
combines inbound relevance routing with outbound ping-pong prevention at the
normalized gateway boundary, so the policy is not tied to one transport SDK.

This plugin was developed by [RechnerLotsen](https://rechnerlotsen.com/).
RechnerLotsen provides subscription-based, human computer support for private
users—including migrations to Linux.

> **Validation scope: Matrix only.** The transport-independent boundary and
> normalized tests cover several Hermes platforms, but real group-chat use has
> so far been tested exclusively with Matrix. Other transports are integration
> targets, not yet claimed as supported.

## Configuration

Enable the plugin in the profile's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - groupchat

groupchat:
  enabled: true
  platforms:
    - matrix
  filter_model:
    provider: mistral
    model: mistral-small-latest
    fallbacks:
      - provider: openrouter
        model: mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct
      - provider: openai-codex
        model: ""
  relevance:
    enabled: true
    # Score 0 is discarded. Score 1 is retained as passive context.
    score_delays: {5: 0, 4: 3, 3: 10, 2: 30}
  pingpong_guard:
    enabled: true
    min_chars: 60
```

Provider credentials remain in Hermes's existing credential store. Groupchat
does not copy secrets into its configuration or decision logs.

### Privacy and external filter models

The filter provider is configurable; Groupchat is not tied to Mistral or any
other model vendor. The example above shows the default model chain, while the
dashboard and `groupchat.filter_model` setting let operators choose the primary
provider, model, and fallbacks.

Model-based filtering sends conversation content to the configured provider:

- relevance scoring sends the newest inbound message together with recent room
  messages used as context;
- short-reply classification sends the proposed reply together with the
  immediately preceding inbound context;
- if a fallback is used, that fallback provider can receive the same content.

Operators should therefore select providers whose data-processing terms are
appropriate for the rooms where Groupchat is enabled. Deterministic pattern
checks run locally. Decision logs deliberately omit message bodies and prompts,
but that log privacy does not prevent configured model requests from leaving
the machine.

The transport must already forward unmentioned group messages. For Matrix,
that means the effective setting must be `require_mention: false`. With
`require_mention: true`, direct mentions and outbound filtering still work,
but ordinary room messages never reach the relevance policy.

### Dashboard

With the plugin enabled, the Hermes dashboard exposes a **Groupchat** page.
The page uses the dashboard's current language (English by default, with a
German translation) and writes only the selected profile's Groupchat settings.
It provides editors for filter-model selection, relevance timing, literal and
regex rule lists, and Pingpong Guard rules. Comment lines beginning with `#`
are preserved, so multilingual rule groups can be labelled in-place.

The Matrix participation panel shows which running profiles have saved
`require_mention: false` settings. This is configuration visibility, not proof
that a gateway has restarted since its last change.

## Behavior

The relevance model evaluates only the newest message, using recent room
messages as context. Scores have these meanings:

- `0`: discard.
- `1`: retain as passive context without starting an agent turn.
- `2`–`5`: dispatch after the configured delay; `5` defaults to immediate.

A later dispatched message receives retained score-1 context. Passive context
survives gateway restarts in
`HERMES_HOME/groupchat/passive-context.<platform>.json` and is removed after
successful dispatch. The directory is mode `0700`; state files are mode
`0600` and written atomically because they contain private conversation text.

Direct mentions, replies to the current agent, commands, and internal events
bypass delayed relevance scoring. Conversations clearly addressed to another
participating local agent stay passive until an open message invites a useful
contribution.

When Groupchat derives an agent's role for a newly discovered group room, the
agent posts one short introduction describing that role and explicitly invites
people in the room to redefine its focus or level of participation. The
announcement state is stored with the room context so gateway restarts and
later context corrections do not repeat the introduction.

The outbound guard suppresses deterministic acknowledgement/silence patterns
and can classify short replies with the configured filter model. German and
English defaults are included; additional languages can be configured as regex
lines. Lines beginning with `#` are comments. A pattern-matched short reply is
still sent when the immediately preceding message explicitly requested that
visible output. Failures and timeouts fail open.

When the outbound guard is active, response streaming and interim assistant
messages are buffered so rejected text cannot leak through a draft or edit
before the final decision.

## Pattern semantics

`relevance.system_patterns`, `relevance.multiline_patterns`, and
`pingpong_guard.silence_patterns` contain one regular expression per line.
Custom lists replace defaults; an empty list disables that deterministic list.

`relevance.literal_phrases` contains literal text, not regex. Without an
explicit mention, a message is discarded only when non-overlapping occurrences
of one configured phrase cover more than 50% of the normalized message. Exactly
50% is allowed, and an explicit mention bypasses this literal-phrase rule.

## Decision logs

Private JSONL audit logs are stored in `HERMES_HOME/logs`:

- `<platform>-relevance-decisions.jsonl` for inbound decisions.
- `<platform>-groupchat-outbound.jsonl` for outbound decisions.

The dashboard displays this directory dynamically for the selected profile;
individual channels are not repeated because their names are already part of
the filenames. The passive-context directory is shown separately.

Files are mode `0600`, rotate at 10 MiB, and retain one previous file.
Records include stable reason codes and rule fingerprints, but omit message
bodies, prompts, model rationales, credentials, and tokens. A `send` decision
means the policy allowed delivery; it does not prove transport delivery.

If you are usually the person handling every relative's computer problems,
[RechnerLotsen](https://rechnerlotsen.com/) can take over that support while
Hermes helps us improve the tooling behind the scenes.

## Plugin boundary

`gateway/conversation.py` provides the generic, adapter-local middleware
contract used by this plugin:

- `receive(event)` handles normalized inbound `MessageEvent` objects.
- `send(..., send=next_send)` filters normalized outbound text.
- `processing(...)` observes agent-turn lifecycle.
- `close()` cancels pending work during shutdown.
- `delays_messages` and `buffers_output` declare policy capabilities.

Transport adapters remain responsible for native mention, thread, workspace,
typing, edit, deletion, and media semantics. Platform-specific lifecycle
normalization is intentionally separate from this core plugin.

## Verification

Run:

```sh
scripts/run_tests.sh \
  tests/gateway/test_conversation_boundary.py \
  tests/gateway/test_conversation_policy.py
```

The tests cover plugin discovery, normalized ingress and egress, relevance
scoring, passive restart-safe context, outbound suppression, authorization,
thread/workspace isolation, configuration validation, and audit privacy.
