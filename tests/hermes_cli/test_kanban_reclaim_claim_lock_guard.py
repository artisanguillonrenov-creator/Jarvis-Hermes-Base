"""Tests: reclaim paths are claim-lock-aware so they can't desync a re-claimed
task (issue #36910).

A stale crash/stale-claim/max-runtime reclaim, computed from a snapshot of an
OLD worker, used to reset ``tasks.status`` back to ``ready`` with only a
``WHERE status='running'`` guard. If the task had since been reclaimed AND
re-claimed by a NEW worker (new run, new claim_lock, live pid), that stale
UPDATE clobbered the live task: ``tasks.status='ready'`` while the new
``task_runs.status='running'`` and the worker kept executing — the board showed
the task in the Ready lane and the dispatcher could treat live work as
available. The reset is now gated on the snapshot's ``claim_lock`` (and pid),
so it only fires when the task is still owned by the worker the reclaim was
computed for.
