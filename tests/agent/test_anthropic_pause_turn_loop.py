"""Loop-level behavior for Anthropic's ``pause_turn`` continuation.

``tests/agent/test_anthropic_web_server_tools.py`` covers the transport half:
``pause_turn`` survives ``map_finish_reason`` and normalization as its own stop
reason rather than collapsing into ``stop``. That is necessary but not
sufficient — the behavior that matters lives in the turn loop's response intake
(``agent/turn_response_intake.py``, driven by ``agent/conversation_loop.py``),
which treats the pause as *provider continuation state* rather than a client
tool call:

* the exact assistant content is appended and replayed, with **no** synthetic
  user or tool message inserted (Anthropic requires the original blocks back);
* the paused turn is persisted, and a persistence failure must not abort the
  continuation — the turn is still recoverable from the live message list;
* continuations are bounded so a pathological upstream cannot silently consume
  the whole agent budget;
* on hitting that bound the fallback chain gets a chance, and only if no
  fallback exists does the turn end as an explicit partial failure.

These drive the real ``run_conversation`` against an in-process mock Anthropic
Messages endpoint, so the assertions are on observable turn behavior — request
count, replayed payloads, result shape — not on a snapshot of internals.
