"""Resume-time orphan-recovery wording by interrupt provenance (#84207).

When an interrupted side-effecting tool survives into replay history, the
recovered note should phrase the cause precisely: a deliberate stop is the
user's own action, a dropped connection is a transport failure.  The
structured ``stop_kind`` stamped on the tool result at execution time
carries that provenance across the restart boundary.
