"""Pre-execution guards for the terminal tool.

Pure functions that decide whether a command may run at all: workdir
validation, the foreground long-lived/background-operator guidance, the
supervised-gateway lifecycle block, and the Windows self-repo git guard.
Each ``*_block`` helper returns a finished JSON error string, or None when
the command may proceed. Split out of tools/terminal_tool.py; the origin
module re-imports every public helper so ``tools.terminal_tool.<name>``
keeps resolving.
