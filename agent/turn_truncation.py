Handles thinking-budget exhaustion, repetition-dominated truncation, content-filter stream
stalls escalated to the fallback chain, text continuation nudges (up to 4, with the ceiling

tool calls (both the provider-flagged ``length`` path and the router-hidden

    and no second, weaker bound.

    ``_retry`` is the loop's LIVE ``TurnRetryState`` (not a fresh throwaway instance), but this

    at the top of the next one — so the restart flag ``_request_chunked_tool_retry`` arms is not
    consumed here. What drives the recovery on this path is the staged chunking nudge on
    ``messages`` plus the ``"break"`` verdict (the loop restarts the iteration); the flag is
    load-bearing only on the ``finish_reason="length"`` path, whose phase runs before
    ``apply_retry_restarts`` in its own iteration. The broken response is discarded here and
