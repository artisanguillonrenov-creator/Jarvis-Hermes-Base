"""Tool-call validation for the conversation turn loop: unknown tool names (with
auto-repair and the 3-strike partial exit) and malformed JSON arguments (retry, then
recovery tool results).

Truncated argument JSON is refused outright (never dispatched). When the provider flagged the
cut (``finish_reason="length"``) the finish_reason phase already ran the bounded recovery, so
this module keeps its terminal refusal; when a router HID the truncation behind
``"tool_calls"``/``"stop"`` this module returns the ``"truncate"`` verdict so the loop can run
the same bounded chunking recovery instead of ending the turn partial.

Role alternation is preserved on every path: an invalid batch is answered with tool-role
error results (never a user message), and the exits close any open tool-result tail
(#48879). Nothing here imports ``agent.conversation_loop`` at module level (cycle).
